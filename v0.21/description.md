# Progressive Angle System - Authentic Atari Pong

## Overview
Your Pong environment implements the **authentic angle progression system** from the original 1972 Atari Pong arcade game. This is the actual difficulty scaling mechanism the original hardware used.

## How It Works

### The Original Atari Pong Mechanic
Rather than increasing ball speed (which would require changing hardware), the 1972 Pong arcade cabinet scaled difficulty by making ball angles **progressively steeper** during rallies.

**Key principle: Ball speed stays constant. Only angles change.**

### Volley Thresholds
The ball's angles get steeper at specific **volley counts** (paddle hits):

- **Volleys 1-3**: Angle multiplier = 1.0x (baseline)
- **Volley 4**: Angle multiplier = 1.15x (15% steeper)
- **Volleys 5-11**: Angle multiplier = 1.15x (maintained)
- **Volley 12**: Angle multiplier = 1.32x (15% steeper again)
- **Volleys 13-19**: Angle multiplier = 1.32x (maintained)
- **Volley 20**: Angle multiplier = 1.52x (15% steeper again)
- **Volleys 21-27**: Angle multiplier = 1.52x (maintained)
- **Volley 28**: Angle multiplier = 1.75x (15% steeper again)
- **Volley 29+**: Angle multiplier = capped at 2.0x

## Configuration

### In `config.py`

```python
# Progressive angle difficulty (AUTHENTIC 1972 ATARI PONG)
USE_PROGRESSIVE_ANGLES = True
ANGLE_INCREASE_VOLLEYS = [4, 12, 20, 28]  # Thresholds where angles get steeper
ANGLE_MULTIPLIER_PER_THRESHOLD = 1.15     # 15% increase per threshold
MAX_ANGLE_MULTIPLIER = 2.0                # Maximum multiplier cap

# Ball speed configuration
BALL_SPEED_CONSTANT = True                # Speed NEVER changes
BALL_SPEED_NORMALIZE_AFTER_EDGE = True    # Maintain constant speed after collisions

# Angle parameters
ANGLE_VARIATION = 0.5                     # Base angle change from paddle hit
MAX_BALL_ANGLE = 4.0                      # Maximum vertical velocity
```

---

## Implementation

### BallMechanics Class (`ball_mechanics.py`)

The `BallMechanics` class manages the progressive angle system:

```python
class BallMechanics:
    def on_paddle_hit(self):
        """Called when ball hits a paddle"""
        self.volley_count += 1
        if self.use_progressive_angles:
            self._apply_progressive_angles()
    
    def _apply_progressive_angles(self):
        """Increase angle multiplier at thresholds"""
        if self.volley_count in self.angle_increase_volleys:
            self.current_angle_multiplier *= self.angle_multiplier_per_threshold
            self.current_angle_multiplier = min(self.current_angle_multiplier,
                                                self.max_angle_multiplier)
    
    def apply_paddle_angle_effect(self, ball_vy, paddle_hit_offset):
        """Apply angle effect scaled by multiplier"""
        # Paddle hit offset: -1.0 (top edge) to +1.0 (bottom edge)
        angle_effect = (paddle_hit_offset * self.angle_variation * 
                       self.current_angle_multiplier)
        ball_vy += angle_effect
        
        # Clamp to maximum angle (also scaled by multiplier)
        max_angle = self.max_ball_angle * self.current_angle_multiplier
        return np.clip(ball_vy, -max_angle, max_angle)
    
    def reset_rally(self):
        """Reset counters when point is scored"""
        self.volley_count = 0
        self.current_angle_multiplier = 1.0
```

### Physics Engine (`physics_engine.py`)

The `PhysicsEngine` maintains constant ball speed:

```python
def normalize_speed(self):
    """Maintain constant ball speed (Atari authentic)"""
    current_speed = np.sqrt(self.ball_vx**2 + self.ball_vy**2)
    if current_speed > 0:
        scale = self.target_ball_speed / current_speed
        self.ball_vx *= scale
        self.ball_vy *= scale
```

This is called after every paddle collision to ensure the ball never speeds up.

## Gameplay Impact

### Early Rally (Volleys 1-3)
- Ball travels mostly horizontally
- Angles are shallow (easy to return)
- Baseline difficulty

### Medium Rally (Volleys 4-11)
- Ball travels at 15% steeper angles
- Requires more vertical paddle movement
- Noticeably more challenging

### Long Rally (Volleys 12-19)
- Ball angles at 32% steeper (1.15²)
- Fast-paced vertical movement
- Skilled play required

### Extended Rally (Volleys 20-27)
- Ball angles at 52% steeper (1.15³)
- Extreme vertical movement needed
- Very challenging

### Epic Rally (Volleys 28+)
- Ball angles at 75% steeper (1.15⁴), capped at 2x
- Extremely fast vertical rebounds
- Like the original arcade: "expert players could maintain rallies indefinitely"

## Why Angles Instead of Speed?

### Hardware Constraints (1972)
The original Atari Pong arcade cabinet had:
- Fixed frame rate (60 Hz)
- Limited CPU (MOS 6502 running at 1 MHz)
- No floating-point unit

Changing speed during gameplay would require expensive recalculation. Instead, the designers cleverly exploited a simple mechanic: **steeper angles create the illusion and reality of difficulty** without changing the ball's speed.

### Psychological Effect
Players perceive steeper angles as "faster" gameplay because:
- The ball moves vertically faster (requires quicker paddle responses)
- The paddle must travel greater distances
- Rally pace accelerates without actual speed increase

---

## Debugging

### Print Game Info
Use `env.get_game_info()` to monitor the system:

```python
info = env.get_game_info()
print(f"Volleys: {info['volley_count']}")
print(f"Angle Multiplier: {info['angle_multiplier']:.2f}x")
print(f"Ball Speed: {info['ball_speed']:.2f} (constant)")
```

### Expected Output During Long Rally
```
Step 150: Volley 8, Angle Multiplier: 1.15x, Ball Speed: 2.83
Step 200: Volley 12, Angle Multiplier: 1.32x, Ball Speed: 2.83
Step 250: Volley 20, Angle Multiplier: 1.52x, Ball Speed: 2.83
Step 300: Volley 28, Angle Multiplier: 2.00x, Ball Speed: 2.83
```

Notice: **Ball speed never changes**, only the angle multiplier.

## Authenticity

This implementation matches the original 1972 Atari Pong because:

✅ Ball speed is constant (never increases)  
✅ Angles progressively steepen during rallies  
✅ Difficulty resets when a point is scored  
✅ Progressive thresholds at 4, 12, 20, 28 volleys  
✅ Matches observed gameplay of original arcade cabinet

## Customization

To modify the difficulty progression:

```python
# Make it easier: fewer angle increases
ANGLE_INCREASE_VOLLEYS = [6, 15]  # Only 2 difficulty jumps

# Make it harder: more frequent increases
ANGLE_INCREASE_VOLLEYS = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]  # 6 difficulty jumps

# Faster difficulty scaling
ANGLE_MULTIPLIER_PER_THRESHOLD = 1.25  # 25% per threshold instead of 15%

# Lower angle cap
MAX_ANGLE_MULTIPLIER = 1.5  # Cap at 1.5x instead of 2.0x
```
